# PGWP
PGWP guidance

---

**Your Situation:**  
- You are an international student in Canada, completing your studies in **December 2024**.  
- You plan to apply for a **Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)** before your current status expires on **March 25, 2025**.  
- Your wife currently holds an **Open Work Permit (OWP)** tied to your student status, also expiring on **March 25, 2025**.  
- You want to know if you can apply for her work permit extension along with your PGWP application or what alternatives she has to maintain her status in Canada.

---

### **Key Points:**

#### 1. **Applying for Your Wife’s Work Permit Along With Your PGWP**  
You **cannot apply for her Open Work Permit (OWP)** at the same time as your PGWP. The extension of her OWP depends on your employment after obtaining your PGWP. Specifically:
   - After you receive your PGWP, you must show proof that you are working in a **NOC 0, A, or B job** (high-skilled job).  
   - Once you secure such employment, your wife will be eligible to apply for an OWP extension based on your employment status.

---

#### 2. **When and How Your Wife Can Apply for an OWP Extension**  
- **When to Apply:**  
   - After you secure employment in a NOC 0, A, or B position.
   - Her current status (valid until March 25, 2025) allows her to remain in Canada until then.  

- **How to Apply:**  
   - Submit an application online through the [IRCC Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada.html).  
   - Documents typically required:
     - Proof of your employment (job offer letter, employment contract, and recent pay stubs).  
     - A copy of your PGWP.  
     - Proof of your relationship (e.g., marriage certificate).  

---

#### 3. **Maintaining Her Status Beyond March 25, 2025**  
If you haven’t secured employment by March 25, 2025, your wife can apply for a **visitor record** to maintain her status while staying in Canada. This application should be submitted **before her current work permit expires**.  

- **Visitor Record Application Details:**  
   - She will not be allowed to work while on visitor status but can stay in Canada legally.  
   - Apply online through the [IRCC Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html).  

---

#### 4. **Alternative Options for Your Wife to Stay in Canada**
   - **Study Permit:**  
     If she wishes to study, she can apply for a study permit before her OWP expires. This allows her to remain in Canada as a student.  
   - **Spousal Sponsorship:**  
     If you transition to permanent residence (e.g., through Express Entry), you could sponsor her as a dependent spouse.

These are excellent follow-up questions! Let’s address each query systematically:

---

### **1. Can you apply for your wife’s work permit extension if you secure a job before receiving your PGWP?**  

Yes, you can apply for your wife’s Open Work Permit (OWP) extension **before you receive your PGWP**, provided:  
- You have proof of employment in a **NOC 0, A, or B job**.  
- You have already submitted your PGWP application, and your student permit is still valid or under implied status.  

In this case, you can demonstrate to IRCC that:  
1. You are transitioning to a PGWP.  
2. You have eligible employment that supports her OWP extension.

---

### **2. Does the job need to be full-time, or is part-time sufficient?**  

To extend your spouse’s work permit, the job typically **must be full-time** (30 hours per week or more) and fall under **NOC 0, A, or B categories**. Part-time employment generally does not meet the eligibility criteria for supporting your spouse’s OWP.  

---

### **3. Can you apply for her work permit if you have a part-time job as a student?**  

No, part-time jobs you hold as a student (e.g., during your study permit period) **cannot be used** to apply for your spouse’s work permit. IRCC only considers full-time skilled employment that you hold **after completing your studies** (e.g., while waiting for your PGWP decision under implied status or after receiving your PGWP).

---

### **4. Can you combine two part-time jobs to support your spouse’s OWP application?**  

Unfortunately, combining multiple part-time jobs to meet the 30-hour-per-week threshold is not generally accepted. IRCC requires evidence of **a single full-time job** in a qualifying NOC category to approve your spouse's OWP.  

However, if one of your part-time jobs transitions into a full-time role in a skilled occupation, you may use that employment to apply for her work permit.  

---

### **Recommendations for Your Situation**  
1. **Focus on Securing Full-Time Employment**:
   - Start applying for full-time jobs in **NOC 0, A, or B** categories as soon as you complete your studies.
   - Mention in your job applications that you will have a PGWP and are eligible to work full-time post-graduation.

2. **Apply for PGWP Quickly**:
   - Submit your PGWP application immediately after completing your program to maintain implied status, which allows you to work full-time until a decision is made.  

3. **Keep Documentation Ready**:
   - If you secure a full-time job before receiving your PGWP, you can include proof of employment (offer letter, contract, pay stubs) with your wife’s OWP extension application.  

4. **Alternative Options for Your Wife**:
   - If there is a delay in obtaining full-time skilled employment, consider applying for a **visitor record** to maintain her status temporarily while you wait to secure eligible employment.  

---

### **Summary**  
- **Full-time skilled employment (NOC 0, A, or B)** is mandatory for your wife’s OWP extension.  
- Part-time jobs (alone or combined) are not sufficient.  
- You can apply for her OWP extension if you secure eligible employment before receiving your PGWP.
