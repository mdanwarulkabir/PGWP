As an international student transitioning to a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP), here’s how you can manage your family's permits:

1. **Your PGWP Application:**
   - Apply for your PGWP as soon as you receive your completion letter or final transcript.
   - Once you submit your PGWP application, you can stay in Canada under maintained status until a decision is made.

2. **Your Wife’s Open Work Permit (OWP):**
   - To extend your wife’s OWP, you must provide proof of your valid PGWP and employment in a skilled job (NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3).
   - Secure a job in a qualifying occupation as soon as possible to support her OWP extension application.

3. **Your Kids’ Study Permits:**
   - Children of PGWP holders (and their spouses) can apply to extend their study permits if one of the parents has a valid PGWP and/or OWP.
   - Once you apply for your PGWP, you should include your children’s study permit extension applications simultaneously or shortly after receiving your PGWP approval.
   - Ensure that the study permits for your children match the validity of your PGWP or your wife’s OWP, whichever is longer.

### Steps to Take:
1. **Prepare Documents:**
   - For your PGWP: Completion letter, final transcript, passport, and proof of status in Canada.
   - For your wife’s OWP: Your employment offer or proof of skilled job after securing it, your PGWP (or confirmation of application), and marriage certificate.
   - For your kids’ study permits: Proof of your PGWP or wife’s OWP, proof of their enrollment in school, and passports.

2. **Apply Simultaneously:**
   - If your result takes time, you may choose to apply for all extensions together as soon as you receive confirmation of your PGWP approval.

3. **Stay Informed:**
   - Check IRCC processing times and ensure all applications are submitted before the current permits expire (March 15, 205).

If you need further guidance or assistance, consider consulting an immigration consultant or lawyer to ensure your family’s status in Canada is maintained smoothly.

### 1. **Understanding NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 Jobs with Examples:**
   - **TEER 0 (Managerial roles):**
     Examples: Restaurant managers, financial managers, marketing managers.
   - **TEER 1 (Occupations requiring a university degree):**
     Examples: Software engineers, accountants, nurses.
   - **TEER 2 (Occupations requiring a college diploma or apprenticeship training of less than two years):**

### 2. **Proof of Status in Canada for PGWP Application:**
   Acceptable documents include:
   - Copy of your **valid study permit**.
   - Copy of your **passport pages**, showing personal details, validity, and entry stamp.
   - A letter of explanation (optional but helpful to clarify your status).

---

### 3. **Proof of Skilled Job for Wife’s Open Work Permit:**
   - A copy of your **employment offer letter** or signed contract specifying your job title, duties, and start date.
   - A recent **pay stub** from your employer or a formal **employment verification letter** to confirm your job.

---

### 4. **Proof of Kids’ Enrollment in School for Study Permit Extension:**
   - A **letter of enrollment** or confirmation from the school.
   - Recent **report cards** or progress reports.
   - A tuition fee receipt (if applicable).

---

### 5. **Can You Apply for Kids’ Study Permit with Your PGWP Application?**
   - Yes, you can apply for their study permit extensions simultaneously with your PGWP application.
   - In this case, you don’t need to submit PGWP approval proof immediately, but include:
     - Proof that you’ve applied for your PGWP (submission confirmation receipt).
     - A letter explaining your current situation and intent to secure your PGWP.

---

### 6. **Applying for Wife’s OWP Without PGWP Approval but with a Full-Time Job:**
   - You **cannot apply for her OWP extension** unless you have:
     1. **PGWP approval**, and
     2. A skilled job (TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3).
   - Without PGWP approval, your spouse’s OWP application will likely be refused unless tied to your valid study permit or another work authorization.

---

### **Next Steps:**
   - Apply for your PGWP promptly.
   - Secure a skilled job to support your wife’s OWP extension.
   - Prepare and submit the children’s study permit extensions with your PGWP or after securing it.
   - Keep timelines and documents ready to maintain family status in Canada.

### 1. **Does the Company Need a Specific Minimum Turnover?**
   - No, there is no requirement for the company to have a specific minimum turnover. What matters is:
     - The job falls under NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3.
     - You provide proper proof of employment, such as an offer letter or pay stubs.

---

### 2. **Minimum Pay Stub Requirement:**
   - IRCC does not specify a minimum duration for pay stubs. However:
     - One or two recent pay stubs (if already employed) are typically sufficient.
     - Combine with an employment offer letter or contract to strengthen your application.

---

### 3. **Is Either a Letter of Enrollment or a Report Card Enough for Kids' Study Permit Extension?**
   - Yes, either is usually sufficient, but it is safer to provide **both** to avoid delays or requests for additional documents.
   - A **letter of enrollment** is preferred as it directly confirms your child’s active attendance.

---

### 4. **PGWP Processing Time and Wife’s Status Ending:**
   - **Processing Time:** PGWP approval can take **2 to 5 months**, depending on IRCC processing times.
   - If your wife’s OWP status is about to expire before your PGWP is approved:
     - You can submit her OWP extension application before the expiry date. This puts her under **maintained status** until IRCC makes a decision.
     - Include your PGWP submission confirmation and a letter explaining your plan to provide proof of skilled employment once PGWP is approved.

---

### 5. **Why Can Kids’ Study Permit Be Applied Without PGWP Approval, but Not Wife’s OWP?**
   - **Children’s Study Permits:**
     - IRCC allows you to apply for dependents’ study permits/extensions if you have a valid study permit or have submitted a PGWP application.
     - This is because children’s eligibility for study permits depends on your status (study or work) rather than your employment status.

   - **Spouse’s Open Work Permit:**
     - Your spouse’s OWP is tied to your **employment in a skilled job (TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3)**, not just your immigration status.
     - Even with a full-time job, without PGWP approval, you are not yet recognized by IRCC as a valid worker under the Post-Graduate Work Permit program.

   **Solution:** Once your PGWP is approved and you secure skilled employment, you can apply for your spouse's OWP extension immediately.

---

### **Recommendations:**
   - Submit your PGWP and your family’s extensions early to maintain status.
   - Gather detailed employment documents for your spouse’s OWP once your PGWP is approved.
   - Regularly check IRCC processing times and consider consulting an immigration professional if you face complications.
