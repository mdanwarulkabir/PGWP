PGWP guidance
Here’s the response to your query, along with references:

---

**Your Situation:**  
- You are an international student in Canada, completing your studies in **December 2024**.  
- You plan to apply for a **Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)** before your current status expires on **March 25, 2025**.  
- Your wife currently holds an **Open Work Permit (OWP)** tied to your student status, also expiring on **March 25, 2025**.  
- You want to know if you can apply for her work permit extension along with your PGWP application or what alternatives she has to maintain her status in Canada.

---

### **Key Points:**

#### 1. **Applying for Your Wife’s Work Permit Along With Your PGWP**  
You **cannot apply for her Open Work Permit (OWP)** at the same time as your PGWP. The extension of her OWP depends on your employment after obtaining your PGWP. Specifically:
   - After you receive your PGWP, you must show proof that you are working in a **NOC 0, A, or B job** (high-skilled job).  
   - Once you secure such employment, your wife will be eligible to apply for an OWP extension based on your employment status.

---

#### 2. **When and How Your Wife Can Apply for an OWP Extension**  
- **When to Apply:**  
   - After you secure employment in a NOC 0, A, or B position.
   - Her current status (valid until March 25, 2025) allows her to remain in Canada until then.  

- **How to Apply:**  
   - Submit an application online through the [IRCC Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada.html).  
   - Documents typically required:
     - Proof of your employment (job offer letter, employment contract, and recent pay stubs).  
     - A copy of your PGWP.  
     - Proof of your relationship (e.g., marriage certificate).

#### 3. **Maintaining Her Status Beyond March 25, 2025**  
If you haven’t secured employment by March 25, 2025, your wife can apply for a **visitor record** to maintain her status while staying in Canada. This application should be submitted **before her current work permit expires**.  

- **Visitor Record Application Details:**  
   - She will not be allowed to work while on visitor status but can stay in Canada legally.  
   - Apply online through the [IRCC Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html).  

---

#### 4. **Alternative Options for Your Wife to Stay in Canada**
   - **Study Permit:**  
     If she wishes to study, she can apply for a study permit before her OWP expires. This allows her to remain in Canada as a student.  
   - **Spousal Sponsorship:**  
     If you transition to permanent residence (e.g., through Express Entry), you could sponsor her as a dependent spouse.
